## Objective

To create an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. The notes must be written and edited in a new file using express.

## Functionality

After installing required packages, 'node server.js' is run in the terminal. Once on the browser on localhost:3000 a home page is displayed with a get started button. When you click on the button, a new page is presented where notes are pulled from a file and displayed on screen. You can then add and delete notes which will add and remove them from the file.

## Challenges/Improvements

I found figuring out how to delete the notes the toughest part of this assignment. Getting it to actually remove the info from the file took a bit to do. This app could be improved by adding the current date to a new note or maybe a better display.
